# loomark Themes

loomark ships 4 built-in themes in the menu (Light, Sepia, Solarized Dark, Nord), and this folder carries more styles you can import as custom themes. Every theme below is available as a standalone `.css` file: download it and place it in `~/.loomark/themes/`, or use **Theme > Import Theme** in loomark to import directly.

See the [theme swatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marswaveai/loomark/main/docs/images/theme-swatches.svg) for a visual preview.

## Creating Your Own Theme

loomark custom themes are plain CSS files. Start from [template.css](template.css): it is a working theme with every variable and a few selectors commented, and the same check that guards the built-in themes runs over it, so it can not teach you a selector that does nothing.

### CSS Variables

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #24292f;
  --text-secondary: #656d76;
  --text-muted: #656d76;
  --border-color: #d0d7de;
  --link-color: #0969da;
  --code-bg: rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
  --code-block-bg: #f6f8fa;
  --code-block-text: #24292f;
  --blockquote-border: #d0d7de;
  --blockquote-bg: transparent;
  --table-header-bg: #f6f8fa;
  --selection-bg: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

`--text-secondary` is for readable labels and secondary copy. `--text-muted`
is reserved for subdued icons and disabled states. Search highlights derive
from `--link-color` automatically and can be overridden with
`--search-match-bg` and `--search-match-current-bg` when needed.

### Direct Selectors

For more control, target the editor's own class names. The editor keeps the file's
text as text and draws the formatting on top of it, so there are no `<h1>` or
`<blockquote>` elements to select. A heading is a *line* with a class, a quote is one
`div` per line, and bold text is a span:

```css
#editor .cm-content { font-family: Georgia, serif; }
#editor .cm-content .cm-md-strong { color: #c44b2b; }
#editor .cm-content .cm-md-atxheading1 { letter-spacing: -0.01em; }
#editor .cm-content .cm-md-codeblock { background: #2c2c2c; color: #e0dcd7; }
```

The hooks available are:

| Selector | What it is |
|----------|------------|
| `#editor .cm-content` | The text column itself: font, size, line height, width |
| `.cm-md-atxheading1` ... `.cm-md-atxheading6` | Heading lines |
| `.cm-md-strong`, `.cm-md-em`, `.cm-md-strike`, `.cm-md-inlinecode`, `.cm-md-highlight` | Inline spans |
| `.cm-md-link`, `.cm-md-url` | Link text and the address behind it |
| `.cm-md-blockquote` | Quote lines |
| `.cm-md-codeblock` | Code block lines (the first and last also carry `-first` / `-last`, which is where the rounding goes) |
| `.cm-md-table-widget th`, `.cm-md-table-widget td` | Table cells |
| `.cm-md-hr` | Horizontal rule |
| `.cm-md-li-0` ... `.cm-md-li-6` | List indentation by depth |

Because a quote or a code block is one `div` per line rather than one box around the
whole thing, keep vertical padding off them: it would be added once for every line.
Use `padding-left` / `padding-right` for breathing room instead.

A selector that matches nothing is a silent no-op, which is how the built-in themes
once shipped rules for an editor they no longer ran on. `npm run verify:themes` in the
repository fails on exactly that: every rule has to hit a real element and change at
least one computed style.

### Tips

- Theme files should be self-contained (no external imports)
- Omitted variables inherit loomark's Light defaults, so override only the tokens your theme needs
- Name the file descriptively: `dark-ocean.css`, `solarized-light.css`, etc.
